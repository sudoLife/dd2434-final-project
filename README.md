# DD2434 Final Project

Welcome to the final project of DD2434!

## Rules

To keep it clean, the following rules apply:

1. Store your datasets in the "datasets" folder. It is added to `.gitignore`.
2. Store your trained models in the "models" folder.
3. Try to adhere to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names)
